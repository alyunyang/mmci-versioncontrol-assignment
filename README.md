Team 3s Version Control Deliverable

+ Description of Use Case
+ Why is it a good use of version control (Git/Github)?
+ Where does it fall short in leveraging version control tools?

While the Sequoia Project uses some form of version control for their Data Use and Reciprocal Support Agreement (DURSA), it fails to leverage the full potential of version control. The Sequoia Project provides multiple versions of the DURSA on their website including previous versions and draft versions with new amendments. However, this method of version control falls short of reaching the full potential of version control. 

The current version control employed by the Sequoia Project does not allow individuals to easily track small changes to the DURSA due to the fact that only full versions of the DURSA are provided which generally have multiple changes, making it difficult to determine more granular changes. Also, due to how the DURSA is currently shared, it is difficult to create a customized version of the DURSA and share it with others, which is something GitHub would allow through the use of forks. Another shortcoming is that without a version control system such as Git, it becomes difficult to collaborate on the actual creation of the DURSA as only one person could work on the document at a time since concurrent edits would be hard to reconcile with each other. Collaboration would allow for a greater number of people to suggest changes and contribute to the document in addition to providing more individuals help verify any changes to the DURSA. Each of these shortcomings could be easily addressed by implementing version control through GitHub.
